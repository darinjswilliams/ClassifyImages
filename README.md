# Python Image Classifier to identify dog breeds

## For this image classification application using a deep learning model called a convolutional neural network (often abbreviated as CNN). CNNs work particularly well for detecting features in images like colors, textures, and edges; then using these features to identify objects in the images. The CNN that has already learned the features from a giant dataset of 1.2 million images called [ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org/). There are different types of CNNs that have different structures (architectures) that work better or worse depending on your criteria. With this project, I have explored the three different architectures (AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet) and determine which is best for the application.

A classifier function in named classifier.py will allow you to use these CNNs to classify the images. The test_classifier.py file contains an example program that demonstrates how to use the classifier function.

Remember that certain breeds of dogs look very similar. The more images of two similar-looking dog breeds that the algorithm has learned from, the more likely the algorithm will be able to distinguish between those two breeds. Some of the following breeds to look very similar: [Great Pyrenees](https://www.google.com/search?q=Great+Pyrenees&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwje252-kpfZAhVF3FMKHeXwB3IQ_AUICigB&biw=1112&bih=1069&udm=2) and [Kuvasz](https://www.google.com/search?q=Kuvasz&spell=1&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi9_9fTkpfZAhWB7FMKHXlKDWoQBQg6KAA&biw=1112&bih=1069&dpr=1&udm=2), [German Shepherd](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1112&bih=1069&ei=d7F8WpaaMc_VzgLW8LvABw&q=German+Shepherd&oq=German+Shepherd&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i67k1j0l2j0i67k1j0l6.31751.41069.0.41515.29.18.4.7.9.0.131.1164.14j2.17.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..2.26.1140.0..0i10k1j0i13k1.112.xUB8_AoVF9w&udm=2) and [Malinois](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1112&bih=1069&ei=orF8WtHWDcOdzwLnyLXgBw&q=Malinois&oq=Malinois&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l3j0i67k1l3j0l2j0i67k1j0.31864.42125.0.42493.23.20.0.1.1.0.132.1460.14j4.19.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..8.14.926.0...75.U5aOu6JZ9Vk&udm=2), [Beagle](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1112&bih=1069&ei=zbF8WqTiHZDxzgKlm5SYBw&q=Beagle&oq=Beagle&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i67k1j0l2j0i67k1l2j0l5.29396.33482.0.34041.12.8.3.1.1.0.126.585.6j2.8.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.12.609...0i10k1.0.Dr92CW2Kqqo&udm=2) and [Walker Hound](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1112&bih=1069&ei=8LF8WteAGND0zgKvlL-IBw&q=Walker+hound&oq=Walker+hound&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l10.20697.23454.0.23773.12.10.0.2.2.0.81.601.10.10.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.12.610...0i67k1.0.GI0QxI1sadY&udm=2), amongst others.

* Determine how well the "best" classification algorithm works
  * Ccorrectly identifying a dog's breed.  If you are confused by the term image classifier look at it simply as a tool that has an input and an output. The Input is an image. The output determines what the image depicts. (for example, a dog). Be mindful of the fact that image classifiers do not always categorize the images correctly.
  * Time how long each algorithm takes to solve the classification problem. With computational tasks, there is often a trade-off between accuracy and runtime. The more accurate an algorithm, the higher the likelihood that it will take more time to run and use more computational resources to run
